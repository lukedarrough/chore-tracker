After cloning, run the following commands to get the backend working: 
```
npm install
  
// linux
PORT=3001 node bin/www
  
// windows
set PORT=3001
node bin/www
```

This will get the backend running on port 3001, which will prevent conflicts with React's default port 3000.

Run the following command to start the front end:
```
npm start
```
Now you can see your app running at http://localhost:3000.
